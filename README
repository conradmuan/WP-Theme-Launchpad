This is NOT a theme. It is just a library of template files that developers will most likely need when creating their own WordPress theme.

In Version 2.1.0
- uses default jQuery library packaged with WordPress instead of overwriting it with Google CDN
- uses grid_12 as the default CSS structure. grid_24's gutters were too skinny
- packaged 960_12_col.css and 960_16_col.css
- added a .show-grid class to show the grid. Use only on development environments
- added showGrid() in script.js which toggles the .show-grid class on .container_12, .container_16 or container_24
- added a better 404 with a search bar

In Version 2.0
- now using HTML5Boileplate, http://www.html5boilerplate.com
- enqueues html5boilerplate's modernizr script and js folder structure
- category and tag template pages are now just in archive.php
- fixed a bug in functions.php

Since version 1.0
It makes the following assumptions:
- One sidebar and one menu wrapped in an init function
- Post thumbnails
- jQuery reregistered under Google CDN and enqueued

WP Theme Launchpad also makes the following assumptions regarding CSS:
- Packaged 960.css framework (if you need it. It is not linked by default)
- Links a reset.css and a text.css, also from the 960.css framework
- A wp-classes.css file contains default WordPress classes
- A menu navigation comes pre-styled as a dropdown

About Launchpad

After writing dozens of WordPress themes from scratch, I wrote WP-Theme-Launchpad as a collection of template files and a functions.php file to help me write WordPress themes faster.

This was originally written to help me out but after reading a thread on www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress, I was inspired to release this library to help out other developers in learning what the common WordPress functions do or to help developers in writing WordPress themes from scratch faster.

It takes care of the basic code and template files so you don't have to rewrite the same things over and over again (things like loops)
